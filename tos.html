      <p class="description">We don't have that many rules when it comes to using our bot. But we do have some.<br>1. Do not attempt to take down the bot in any way, that being spamming commands or, ratelimiting the bot.<br>2. Do not attempt to get the bot banned from discord.<br>Altruistic is a closed-source bot, attempting to gain access to the code and distributing it anywhere will lead to a full blacklist of you and any of your friends (trust me, we will find out)<br>This page may be updated at any time.</p>
